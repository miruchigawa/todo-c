# Todo List C

A complete progam Todo List written on pure c and assembly and dosn't rely c standard library so all think in this progam is written on assembly from scratch.

This program is build for targeting to arm64 or Aarch64 architecture so you will need emulator like qemu or maybe run on arm devices for better result


## How to build

So if you a c developer maybe you will know how to build this shit, this program does'nt required any flags except `-nostdlib` flag 

## Developer Note

I dom't have any idea behind this project. This project i created beacuse i challenge myself to build something from scratch without any library include standard library so this idea is come up and I'm really sorry for bad code beacuse i don't have many times for fix that

My reason behind why i choice arm64 architecture beacuse it's really simple and i have basic knowpedge on arm64 architecture so i choice this instead like intel x86. so if you want learn just checkout at my repository.
